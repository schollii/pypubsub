Overview
========

Provides a publish-subscribe API to facilitate event-based or message-based
architecture in a single-process application. It is pure Python and works on
Python 3.3+. It is centered on the notion of a topic; senders publish
messages of a given topic, and listeners subscribe to messages of a given
topic, all inside the same process. The package also supports a variety of
advanced features that facilitate debugging and maintaining topics
and messages in larger desktop- or server-based applications.

Install most recent stable with "pip install pypubsub".
